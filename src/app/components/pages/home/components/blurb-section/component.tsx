                I believe the key to success is rooted 
                in learning and constant mentorship. 
                Javascript can be fun and easy, or it can be really hard.
                The sucky part about Javascript is that it's all up to you.
                It's also the best part because it leaves room for innovation.

                I started writing CSS, HTML and JavaScript
                sometime around 2003. Since then these languages
                have mutated and evolved, and they aren't done either.
